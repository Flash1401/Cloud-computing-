Infrastructure-as-a-Service, commonly referred to as simply “IaaS,” is a form of cloud computing 
that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over 
the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go basis. IaaS enables end users to scale and shrink resources on 
an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high, up-front capital expenditures or unnecessary 
“owned” infrastructure, especially in the case of “spiky” workloads.
